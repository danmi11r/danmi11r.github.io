## Introduction

After spending a lot of time working on my other PyQt5 project, ClockUI, I wanted to apply my experience with the platform to something a little more interesting. Not to say that ClockUI is boring, but the content is largely static and in my opinion, one of the fun challenges of creating a GUI is presenting information in an interesting and engaging way. With this in mind, I decided to work with live OBD2 vehicle data to create a customizable digital dashboard.

A full write-up of this project, as well as detailed installation instructions, is on the way! For now, [you can find the fill project on github.](https://github.com/danm11r/OBD2dashUI)
